\section{RandomForestClassifier()}
The last classifier used is the \class{RandomForestClassifier()} from \code{sklearn.ensemble}.
A random forest is a type of ensemble learning method.
An ensemble method is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to make more accurate predictions than any individual model.
In a Random Forest, a set of decision trees are typically trained on a subset of the original dataset, however in some cases each tree can be trained on the entire data set.
The predicted class of an input sample is a vote by the trees in the forest, weighted by their probability estimates.
That is, the predicted class is the one with highest mean probability estimate across the trees.
This means that a random forest is not as prone to overfitting as a single decision tree, since this voting process helps to reduce the variance of the model.
