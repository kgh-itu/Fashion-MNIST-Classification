\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we found that models with more complexity were able to more accurately identify the clothing types in the dataset.
All three models performed well, but the more complex neural network had the highest accuracy.
When deciding which model to use, it's important to consider both accuracy and interpretability.
If accuracy is the top priority, the complex neural network may be the best choice.
However, if it's important to be able to understand and interpret the model, a random forest or decision tree may be more suitable.
