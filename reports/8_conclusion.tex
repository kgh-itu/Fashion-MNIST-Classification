\section{Conclusion}
In this machine learning project, we found that more complex models lead to a higher chance at identifying the correct clothing type.
All three models were able to deal with the complexity of the dataset to a satisfactory degree and create complex decision boundaries for accurate predictions.
When choosing the 'best' model of the three there are two things to consider.
1) Accuracy, 2) Interpretation of the model.
If accuracy is the most important consideration, a complex neural network may be the best option.
However, if interpretability is the most important, a random forest or random tree are better.
