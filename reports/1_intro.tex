\section{Introduction}
In this project, we will investigate different techniques for determining the type of clothing in an image using a dataset of 15,000 labeled images.
The images are from the Zalando website and depict t-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, and shirts.
We will examine three classification methods: feed-forward neural networks, decision trees, and random forests.
The first two methods will be implemented using only Python standard libraries and the NumPy numerical library, while for the last method we will be using the preexisting implementation from Scikit-learn.
In addition, we will perform exploratory data analysis and visualization of the dataset through a principal component analysis.
The report will cover the \cite{johnson_how_2002} implementation of the methods, as well as an interpretation and comparison of their performances.
